# Why Buy One of the Books in the *mjolnir_poeto* Series?

Welcome! This directory contains an invitation, a question, and perhaps even an answer.

**Why should you consider buying one of the books in the *mjolnir_poeto* series?**

## 1. Perfect for Esperanto Beginners (A1â€“A2 Level)

These books are designed with *you* in mindâ€”whether you're just starting your Esperanto journey or are at the lower-intermediate level. Each poem is written to be accessible and encouraging, with minimal grammar and vocabulary hurdles. 

## 2. Like Board Books, But For Adults

Think of these books as the digital equivalent of board booksâ€”simple, sturdy, and beautiful. But instead of teaching toddlers their first words, these collections gently introduce you to Esperanto vocabulary through haiku and minimalist poetry. Theyâ€™re easy to dip into and surprisingly powerful for building your word bank.

## 3. Learn Poetic and Evocative Words

Even if youâ€™re not an Esperanto enthusiast, the words youâ€™ll encounter in these poems can add something special to your lifeâ€”beauty, poetry, maybe even a touch of romance. These are the kinds of words youâ€™ll want to whisper, repeat, and remember.

## 4. Theyâ€™re Only a Dollar

Most books in the series cost less than a cup of coffee. For just around **$1**, you get a bilingual poetry collection, a language learning tool, and a glimpse into a quiet, creative experiment that is still unfolding.

## TL;DR

- âœ… Designed for beginners (A1â€“A2)
- âœ… Helps you learn new words naturally
- âœ… Encourages poetic thinking
- âœ… Low-cost and zero clutter
- âœ… Part of an evolving creative project

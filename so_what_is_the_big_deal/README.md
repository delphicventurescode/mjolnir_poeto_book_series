# So, What Is the Big Deal?

This directory explains the significance behind the creation of *The Dead Japanese Poets’ Society Poetry Book* and related works.

## A Beginner’s Journey

I am writing this book as a **komencanto** — a beginner — still at the **A1** level of Esperanto proficiency. In essence, I consider myself more of a translator than a fluent writer. Despite this, what is truly remarkable is how quickly one can grasp the structure of certain constructed languages (conlangs).

## Rapid Language Acquisition and Writing

The ability to write entire books while still at such an early stage of language learning points to a fascinating linguistic phenomenon: the rapid uptake of conlang structures. I have developed a couple of conlangs that intentionally exploit this effect, making it easier for learners to engage with language creation and use.

## Implications for Improving Literacy Outcomes and For Organizational Development

By using conlangs designed in this way, it may be possible to significantly improve literacy outcomes. This approach could have far-reaching implications for education and literacy development, especially in countries where learning resources or formal instruction may be limited. In addition, certain types of organizational problems can be solved as well. Problems such as requiring native vernacular speakers to speak English at work.

Of course, the former remains a hypothesis requiring further empirical testing. (And if supported, it could open new avenues for language learning and literacy advancement worldwide.) But the latter phenomenon is pretty 
well established. So, what is to prevent us from adopting ConLangs such as Hesperanto immediately? We can eradicate certain types of problems right away. We only have to commit to doing it.

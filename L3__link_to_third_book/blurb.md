# 🌿 *Alia Meditado pri Hindaj Monumentoj* 🌿  
### *Whispers of Stone and Sky – Haiku Meditations on Indian Monuments – in Esperanto*

Step into the quiet, sun-warmed courtyards of India’s ancient monuments through a sequence of lyrical haiku—each one written in **Esperanto** and inspired by a specific place. From the flickering lamps of **Madurai temples** to the shifting reflections of **Udaipur’s lakes**, this collection captures the poetic essence of *history, memory, and place*.

Crafted for readers at the **A1–A2 level** of Esperanto, these 17-syllable verses invite you to experience both *language* and *landscape* in a gentle, meditative way.

This volume continues the **mjolnir_poeto** project—an exploration of **artificial intelligence**, **human creativity**, and the power of **constructed languages** to unlock artistic potential for beginners and polyglots alike.

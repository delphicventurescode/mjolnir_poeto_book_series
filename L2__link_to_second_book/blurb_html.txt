<p><b>SOMERA MEDITADO PRI HINDAJ MONUMENTOJ</b><br>
<i>A Collection of Haikus in Esperanto</i></p>

<p>Step into the stillness of Indian summer, where the stonework of palaces, temples, and forts meets the delicate art of haiku. Written in Esperanto, this evocative collection captures the poetic essence of India’s most iconic cities and monuments—from the quiet majesty of the Taj Mahal to the burning ghats of Varanasi, from the monsoon-drenched arches of Jaipur to the meditative calm of Dharamshala. This book is part of the <i>mjolnir_poeto</i> series. To understand why I have written more than ten books in this book series, please visit my GitHub.</p>

<p>Each poem is a miniature meditation, composed in the spirit of traditional Japanese haiku masters, yet deeply rooted in the Indian landscape. Whether you're a student of Esperanto, a lover of poetry, or someone drawn to cultural bridges, this book offers a unique and immersive experience.</p>

<p><b>Highlights:</b></p>

<ul>
	<li><p>Fifteen to nineteen original haikus in Esperanto. Bilingual book in English and Esperanto.</p>
	</li>
	<li><p>All poems written in accessible Esperanto (A1–A2 level). Written by someone who is still at an A1 level, proving the power of constructed languages to be <i>grokked</i> easily in terms of grammar and structure even by beginners.</p>
	</li>
	<li><p>Celebrates both language learning and cross-cultural artistry</p>
	</li>
	<li><p>A perfect introduction to literary Esperanto and Indian heritage sites</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>This is not just a book—it’s a quiet effort in creativity, and multilingual expression.</p>

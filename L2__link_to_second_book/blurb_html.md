# **SOMERA MEDITADO PRI HINDAJ MONUMENTOJ**  
*A Collection of Haikus in Esperanto*

Step into the stillness of Indian summer, where the stonework of palaces, temples, and forts meets the delicate art of haiku. Written in **Esperanto**, this evocative collection captures the poetic essence of India’s most iconic cities and monuments — from the quiet majesty of the **Taj Mahal** to the ghats of **Varanasi**, from the monsoon-drenched arches of **Jaipur** to the meditative calm of **Dharamshala**.

This book is part of the *mjolnir_poeto* series.  
To understand why I have written more than ten books in this series, please visit my [GitHub](https://github.com/qwykr/mjolnir_poeto_book_series).

Each poem is a miniature meditation, composed in the spirit of traditional Japanese haiku masters, yet deeply rooted in the Indian landscape. Whether you're a student of Esperanto, a lover of poetry, or someone drawn to cultural bridges, this book offers a unique and immersive experience.

# mjolnir_poeto_book_series

This repository contains some information and illustrative content related to the **Mjolnir_Poeto** book series—an AI-assisted poetry project.

Sample pages have been provided from one of the books in the book series. Also, the code in this repository uploaded to the src/ directory can be easily seen to be designed to support early-stage language learners, for example, in Esperanto and Hindi.
## Contents

### `/src/`
This directory contains a few sample Python files (as of June 8, 2025), intended to illustrate how simple code can be used to support basic language learning. These files are representative and not the complete software suite behind the Mjolnir_Poeto project or the larger Mjolnir system. Much of the software remains private (as would be obvious, since there really isn't even much code to even go through in the src/ directory).

### `/myFirstEsperantoBook/`
**Definitely** go through the contents of this directory. Enough said. In fact, do that right away, and come back here when you are done.

Ah! now, we are back!

### `/sample_pages/`
This directory contains a few sample pages from one of the books in the Mjolnir_poeto book series. These pages are meant to give you an idea of the sort of haikus you might come across in the books in the book series. Please note that
Majolnir_poeto is (a small) part of the larger RALPH project, which, we believe, assuming empirical results bear it out, has significant potential to meaningfully impact literacy rates in many parts of Asia and Africa.

### `/philosophy_behind_mjolnir_poeto/`
This folder includes a document outlining the philosophy behind the Mjolnir_Poeto book series. It describes the guiding principles of the project, the educational intent, the role of AI in accessible content creation, and its connection to the broader Gxoja Projekto (Happiness Project), which promotes happiness, generally speaking. La Gxoja Projekto would like to encourage joyful and fearless learning for children and adults through simple, open-source tools. As part of the Mjolnir_poeto series, an entirely new language has been developed. This is an artificial language, or, as linguists would say, it is a ConLang or constructed language. Even though I was at *the A1 level* in Esperanto, I still *managed to write a book* in the language. That is because Esperanto has a very simple grammar
and predictable rules. That tells you something about the clever way languages can be constructed. Please go to the directory /myFirstEsperantoBook/ to learn more.

### `/oldbokos_newbooks/`
This folder includes information on which of mybooks in the mjolnir_poeto series are the Malnovaj Libroj (the "old books") and which ones are the Novaj Libroj (that is, the "new books").


### `/cut_and_paste_of_intro/`
This folder includes a PDF file containing the full **Introduction** section from the book *La Juvelo en la Krono: Nun Eĉ Plie Plibonigita* ("The Jewel in the Crown: Now Even Further Improved"). This has been provided publicly to clarify the series' scope and purpose for readers—particularly those on platforms like Amazon, where Esperanto is not officially supported. Some reviewers on Amazon seem to have reviewed one of the books in the book series, namely, "The Jewel in the Crown, New and Improved" without realizing and/or understanding the broader aims of the Mjolnir_Poeto project.

### `/so_what_is_the_big_deal/`

This directory explores the significance behind the creation of *The Dead Japanese Poets’ Society Poetry Book* and similar works within the Mjolnir_Poeto project.

Unlike many language learning or literary projects, this book was written by a **komencanto** (beginner) at the **A1 level** of Esperanto proficiency. Rather than an expert writer, the author considers themselves primarily a translator at this stage.

What makes this noteworthy is the rapid uptake of constructed language (conlang) structures, enabling even beginners to write meaningful literary works. The project includes conlangs specifically designed to leverage this effect, making it easier to engage learners and support early literacy development.

This approach may hold important implications for literacy outcomes, especially in countries where access to traditional language education is limited. While still a hypothesis pending even more empirical validation, this methodology could offer a new pathway for enhancing literacy worldwide through conlangs.

For more details, please refer to the README file within the so_what_is_the_big_deal/ directory.

## Disclaimer and Clarification

Please note that this repository contains (very) limited portions of the overall project. Most of the software code and datasets used to generate the poems and language tools remain proprietary or unpublished at this time. Most (or all) of the software to manage finances for literacy projects also likewise remains proprietary or unpublished at this time. Most (or all) of the software to manage tasks for literacy projects also likewise remains proprietary or unpublished at this time.

For more updates, stay tuned to this repository or visit the LeanPub editions of the books. The Esperanto version of the Japanese Dead Poets' Society Poetry Book is available on LeanPub here:

Please consider supporting LeanPub, a Canada-based book publisher that allows for books in languages such as Esperanto to be published, and also our project by purchasing one of our books.

Some reviewers on Amazon have expressed confusion about the purpose of this book series. The core issue lies with the Amazon platform’s limited support for Esperanto. This stems from a technical limitation: Amazon currently lacks the capability to detect plagiarism in Esperanto, likely because they have not yet assembled a sufficiently large corpus of written material in the language. This is not a limitation of the books or the author, but of Amazon’s system. While we have not spelled this out on Amazon—partly because mentioning that the Amazon platform has these shortcomings and that these books are also published on LeanPub, a competing platform which supports Esperanto, might not be welcome in the book’s blurb—this reality affects how the books are presented and reviewed on Amazon.

We understand the frustration this causes readers. Amazon’s platform does not allow this project to be fully self-describing, at least not there. In the spirit of continuous improvement, we have created a GitHub repository to share more information and resources related to the series. It is, of course, this one. We have uploaded the entire foreword of the book also here. You can explore it here:

- The files includes in the philosophy_behind_mjolnir_poeto/ directory contains information pertaining to the philosophy behind the Mjolnir series.
and there is other content here in this repo as well, but MOST IMPORANTLY:

- The files includes in the what_is_the_big_deal/ directory tells you 
  *what is the big deal*
  around all of this.
